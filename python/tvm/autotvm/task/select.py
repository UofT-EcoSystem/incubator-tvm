    ratio of overlapped tuning space between tasks. Accordingly, we create a graph
    with tasks as nodes and SM (>=0.01) as edge weight, and then find all cliques
    in the graph as clusters. For the task that has been included by more than one
    cliques, we assign it to the clique with higher weight sum between the task and
    other tasks in the clique. Finally, every non-empty clique is a cluster, and
    the task with the highest weight sum is the representative task of that cluster,
    meaning that all other tasks in the cluster will depend on it.
